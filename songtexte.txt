Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it: New York, New York
These vagabond shoes are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it: New York, New York
I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap
These little town blues are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York.
New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
And find I'm a number one, top of the list
King of the hill, a number one
These little town blues are melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it in old New York
And if I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York.

London calling to the faraway towns
Now war is declared, and battle come down
London calling to the underworld
Come outta the cupboard, ya boys and girls
London calling, now don't look to us
Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust
London calling, see we ain't got no swing
Except for the ring of that truncheon thing
The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Meltdown expected, the wheat is growin' thin
Engines stop running, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drownin', and I live by the river
(London calling) to the imitation zone
Forget it, brother, you can go it alone
London calling to the zombies of death
Quit holdin' out and draw another breath
London calling, and I don't wanna shout
But while we were talking, I saw you noddin' out
London calling, see we ain't got no Hyde
'Cept for that one with the yellowy eyes
The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growin' thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning, and I, I live by the river
The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growin' thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning, an' I, I live by the river
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Now get this
(London calling) Yes, I was there, too
And ya know what they said? Well, some of it was true
(London calling) At the top of the dial
And after all this, won't you give me a smile?
I never felt so much alike, alike, alike

I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's comin' in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you"
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa.
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Ooh, hoo
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa.
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Ooh, hoo
"Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you"
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (I'm gonna take the time)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Ooh, hoo


Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie.
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all belong?

You know I love that organic cooking
I always ask for more
And they call me Mr. Natural
On down to the health food store
I only eat good sea salt
White sugar dont touch my lips
And my friends is always
Begging me to take them
On macrobiotic trips
Yes, they are
Oh, but at night I take out my strongbox
That I keep under lock and key
And I take it off to my closet
Where nobody else can see
I open that door so slowly
Take a peek up north and south
Then I pull out a Hostess Twinkie
And I pop it in my mouth
Yeah, in the daytime I'm Mr. Natural
Just as healthy as I can be
But at night I'm a junk food junkie
Good Lord have pity on me
Well, at lunchtime
You can always find me
At the Whole Earth Vitamin Bar
Just sucking on my plain white yogurt
From my hand thrown pottery jar
And sippin' a little hand pressed cider
With a carrot stick for dessert
And wiping my face in a natural way
On the sleeve of my peasant shirt
Oh, yeah
Ah, but when that clock strikes midnight
And I'm all by myself
I work that combination
On my secret hideaway shelf
And I pull out some Fritos corn chips
Dr. Pepper and an Ole Moon Pie
Then I sit back in glorious expectation
Of a genuine junk food high
Oh yeah, in the daytime I'm Mr. Natural
Just as healthy as I can be
But at night I'm a junk food junkie
Good Lord have pity on me
My friends down at the commune
They think I'm pretty neat
Oh, I don't know nothing about arts and crafts
But I give 'em all something to eat
I'm a friend to old Euell Gibbons
And I only eat homegrown spice
I got a John Keats autographed Grecian urn
Filled up with my brown rice
Yes, I do
Oh, but folks lately I have been spotted
With a Big Mac on my breath
Stumbling into a Colonel Sanders
With a face as white as death
I'm afraid someday they'll find me
Just stretched out on my bed
With a handful of Pringles Potato Chips.
And a Ding Dong by my head
In the daytime I'm Mr. Natural
Just as healthy as I can be
But at night I'm a junk food junkie
Good Lord have pity on me

I'd like to do a song of great social and political import
It goes like this
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
So, oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?
Dialing For Dollars is trying to find me
I wait for delivery each day until three
So, oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town?
I'm counting on you Lord, please don't let me down
Prove that you love me and buy the next round
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town?
Everybody
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
So, oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philippe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
Southside

It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sittin' next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad, and it's sweet, and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes"
La, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da da-dum
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me"
As the smile ran away from his face
"Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"
Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da da-dum
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the navy
And probably will be for life
And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"
Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da da-dum
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

Bright light city gonna set my soul
Gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher
There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
And they're all living the devil may care
And I'm just a devil with love to spare
So Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
How I wish that there were more
Than the 24 hours in the day
Even if there were 40 more
I wouldn't sleep a minute away
Oh, there's blackjack and poker and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel
Viva Las Vegas.
Viva Las Vegas.
Viva Las Vegas with you neon flashing
And your one arm bandits crashing
All those hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas, turning day into nighttime
Turning night into daytime
If you see it once
You'll never be the same again
I'm gonna keep on the run, I'm gonna have me some fun
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke, oh well, I'll always remember
That I had a swinging time
I'm gonna give it everything I've got
Lady luck please let the dice stay hot
Let me shoot a seven with every shot
Viva Las Vegas.
Viva Las Vegas.
Viva Las Vegas.
Viva, Viva Las Vegas.
